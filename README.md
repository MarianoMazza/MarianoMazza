### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Mariano Mazza
#### How's it going?
I've got professional experience as a Full-Stack Developer and a Games Developer.
Technologies I enjoy working with include C#, Java, Javascript, Unity, and more.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: mazza.mariano@gmail.com  
- âš¡ Fun fact: When I was a child, I wanted to work with computers by day and be an artist by night. That's why as an adult, I ended up with a degree both in Computer Science and in Multimedia Design.
